# Permission System Restructuring Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to restructure the existing permission system implementation to match the desired architecture while preserving existing functionality.

## Current Status
- Existing implementation provides all core functionality
- Code is organized differently than desired
- Functionality is spread across multiple files
- Testing is comprehensive but needs reorganization

## Restructuring Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation and Documentation
- [ ] Create backup branch of current implementation
- [ ] Document all existing functionality
- [ ] Map current implementation to new structure
- [ ] Create test coverage report
- [ ] Identify critical paths and dependencies

### Phase 2: Core Domain Migration
1. Current Location: `forge_domain/src/permission/`
2. Steps:
   - [ ] Create new core.rs with existing types from types.rs
   - [ ] Merge relevant parts from state.rs into core.rs
   - [ ] Update error types in new structure
   - [ ] Ensure all existing functionality is preserved
   - [ ] Validate test coverage
   
### Phase 3: Configuration Restructuring
1. Current Implementation: config.rs and config_loader.rs
2. Steps:
   - [ ] Create new config/ directory structure
   - [ ] Migrate existing config types to schema.rs
   - [ ] Move loading logic to parser.rs
   - [ ] Update YAML handling
   - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing configs
   
### Phase 4: Service Layer Reorganization
1. Current: service.rs, manager.rs, state_manager.rs
2. Steps:
   - [ ] Create service/ directory
   - [ ] Migrate core service functionality
   - [ ] Move state management into dedicated module
   - [ ] Update service interfaces
   - [ ] Preserve existing behavior

### Phase 5: Storage Layer Refactoring
1. Current: storage/session.rs, storage/config.rs
2. Steps:
   - [ ] Create new storage structure
   - [ ] Migrate session storage
   - [ ] Update config storage
   - [ ] Ensure data persistence compatibility
   - [ ] Verify cache behavior

### Phase 6: CLI Interface Updates
1. Current: cli.rs, result.rs
2. Steps:
   - [ ] Create cli/ directory structure
   - [ ] Split functionality into modules
   - [ ] Update display formatting
   - [ ] Maintain user interaction patterns
   - [ ] Preserve existing command syntax

### Phase 7: Testing Migration
1. Steps:
   - [ ] Create new test directory structure
   - [ ] Migrate existing tests to new organization
   - [ ] Add new integration tests
   - [ ] Verify coverage of refactored code
   - [ ] Update test utilities and helpers

### Phase 8: Documentation Updates
1. Tasks:
   - [ ] Create new permissions.md
   - [ ] Write migration guide
   - [ ] Update API documentation
   - [ ] Revise example configurations
   - [ ] Document new organization

## Migration Support
1. Backward Compatibility:
   - Maintain existing configuration format support
   - Preserve current permission states
   - Keep current CLI interface

2. Data Migration:
   - Tool for converting old configs to new format
   - State preservation during upgrade
   - Rollback procedures

## Testing Strategy
1. Continuous Testing:
   - Run tests after each module migration
   - Verify behavior preservation
   - Check integration points
   - Validate error handling

2. Coverage Requirements:
   - Maintain 100% coverage of core functionality
   - Integration tests for all major flows
   - Property-based tests for critical components

## Review Points
After each phase:
1. Code Review:
   - Functionality preservation
   - Architecture compliance
   - Error handling
   - Documentation quality

2. Testing Review:
   - Coverage metrics
   - Test quality
   - Integration test results

3. Documentation Review:
   - Technical accuracy
   - Completeness
   - Migration guidance

## Timeline Estimates
- Phase 1: 1 day
- Phase 2-6: 2 days each
- Phase 7: 1 day
- Phase 8: 1 day
Total: ~14 days

## Success Criteria
1. All existing functionality preserved
2. 100% test coverage maintained
3. No breaking changes in public API
4. Complete documentation
5. Clean architecture alignment
6. All integration tests passing

## Risk Mitigation
1. Immediate Risks:
   - Data format compatibility
   - Breaking changes in public API
   - Test coverage gaps

2. Mitigation Strategies:
   - Comprehensive testing before each merge
   - Staged rollout capability
   - Backup and rollback procedures
   - Version compatibility layer

## Next Steps
1. Create backup branch
2. Begin Phase 1 documentation
3. Set up test coverage monitoring
4. Start core domain migration
