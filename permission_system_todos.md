# Permission System Implementation Todos

<user_feedback>
1. Drop UI components - Focus on core functionality first
2. Use forge_walker crate whenever possible for file system operations
3. Follow service.md pattern strictly for all service implementations
4. Maintain proper error separation between modules
5. Always keep the complete todo list - No truncation
6. Update feedback and learnings after each implementation
7. Document implementation decisions and patterns
8. Use proper naming conventions in YAML/JSON for enum variants
9. Keep session state in memory only - no time-based expiration
10. Handle state changes atomically and consistently
11. Clone state before returning to prevent race conditions
12. Tools should not be directly concerned with permissions
13. Use proxy/interceptor pattern for permission checks
14. Keep permission logic centralized
15. Maintain clean separation between tools and permissions
16. Permission checks should be at service layer to avoid tool modifications
17. Use feature flags for test utilities to maintain clean separation

1. Service Pattern Compliance:
   - Follow strict factory pattern from service.md
   - Keep live implementations private
   - Public test implementations
1. Result Type Conflicts:
   - Need to avoid generic Result type names
   - Use specific types like PermissionResult to prevent ambiguity
   - Be explicit in module-specific result types

2. Crate Integration:
   - forge_walker provides robust file system traversal
   - Leverage existing gitignore and hidden file handling
   - Use Walker's max_depth feature for directory access control

3. Testing Strategy:
   - Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
   - Include both unit and integration tests
   - Use snapshot testing for complex scenarios
   - Start with test implementation before live service
   - Use builder pattern for test setup

4. Architecture:
   - Keep clear separation between domain and implementation
   - Follow established service patterns
   - Maintain proper module hierarchy
   - Services should be async by default
   - Use trait bounds for Send + Sync

5. Service Implementation:
   - Use builder pattern for test implementations
   - Keep test implementations in tests module
   - Implement comprehensive service tests upfront
   - Add thorough documentation for each trait method
   - Consider permission expiration in design
   - Service traits should be focused and cohesive
   - Method naming should be clear and consistent
   - Consider future extensibility in trait design

6. Error Handling:
   - Use domain-specific error types
   - Implement From traits for error conversion
   - Keep error types extensible for future needs
   - Include context in error messages

7. Documentation Practices:
   - Document trait methods with examples
   - Include failure scenarios in documentation
   - Document thread safety requirements
   - Keep implementation details in private modules
   - Use consistent documentation style

8. Code Organization:
   - Keep related functionality grouped
   - Use feature flags for optional components
   - Maintain clear module boundaries
   - Follow consistent file naming conventions
   - Group test utilities effectively

9. Service Pattern Insights:
   - Factory methods should be infallible
   - Live implementations should be private
   - Test implementations should be public
   - Use type aliases for complex return types
   - Consider service dependencies carefully

10. Configuration Patterns:
    - Use serde attributes for customization
    - Implement custom serializers when needed
    - Provide clear defaults
    - Use strong types for all values
    - Support both YAML and JSON formats
    - Keep configuration simple and focused
    - Document configuration format clearly

11. State Management:
    - Keep session state in process memory
    - Use boolean flags for active/inactive state
    - Reset state on process restart
    - Avoid time-based expiration complexity
    - Make state changes explicit and traceable
    - Consider atomic operations for state changes

12. Thread Safety:
    - Use Arc for shared ownership
    - RwLock for mutable state access
    - Clone state before returning
    - Avoid holding locks across await points
    - Consider lock granularity carefully
    - Document threading assumptions

13. Walker Integration:
    - Create new walker instances as needed
    - Handle walker errors appropriately
    - Use walker for path validation
    - Leverage walker's built-in features
    - Consider caching walker instances
    - Document walker usage patterns   - Use builder pattern for configuration
   - Services must be Send + Sync
   - Services should handle cross-cutting concerns
   - Core functionality should stay focused

2. Integration Strategy:
   - Add layers without modifying existing tools
   - Keep core tools focused on single responsibility
   - Use service layer for cross-cutting concerns
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Keep changes localized
   - Use feature flags for test utilities

3. Permission Design:
   - Permission checks at service layer
   - Tool implementations stay focused
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Reusable permission components
   - Use feature flags for test code
   - Centralize permission logic
   - Handle permissions before tool execution

4. Testing Approach:
   - Test service pattern for mocks
   - Use test-utils feature flag
   - Comprehensive permission tests
   - Integration test coverage
   - Permission validation tests
   - Test both positive and negative cases
   - Add debug output for failures

5. Code Organization:
   - Use feature flags for test code
   - Keep imports clean and minimal
   - Use cfg attributes correctly
   - Follow consistent patterns
   - Maintain clear module boundaries
   - Keep implementation details private

6. Error Handling:
   - Return early on permission errors
   - Use clear error messages
   - Format errors consistently
   - Test error cases explicitly
   - Log errors for debugging
   - Maintain error type hierarchy
