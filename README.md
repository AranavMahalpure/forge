## Installation

### Mac

Using Homebrew (macOS package manager):

```bash
# Add Code-Forge's package repository to Homebrew
brew tap antinomyhq/code-forge
# Install Code-Forge
brew install code-forge
```

### Linux

Choose either method to install:

```bash
# Using curl (common download tool)
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antinomyhq/forge/main/install.sh | bash

# Or using wget (alternative download tool)
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antinomyhq/forge/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Get Started

1. Create a `.env` file in your home directory with your API credentials:

```bash
# Your API key for accessing AI models (see Environment Configuration section)
OPEN_ROUTER_KEY=<Enter your Open Router Key>
```
To create an API key, visit [Open Router](https://openrouter.ai/)

2. Start an interactive shell by typing `forge`:

```bash
forge
âš¡ # Write your task here and press enter or type
```

For additional configuration options and features, use `forge --help`.

## Environment Configuration

Code-Forge can be configured through environment variables. You can set these in your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) or by creating a `.env` file in your home directory.

## Features

### 1. Interactive Shell

Transform your command-line experience with natural language interaction while maintaining the power and flexibility of traditional shell commands.

**Example**:
Start the interactive shell with:

```bash
forge
```

### 2. Enhanced Security

Code-Forge prioritizes security by providing a restricted shell mode (rbash) that limits potentially dangerous operations:

- **Flexible Security Options**: Choose between standard and restricted modes based on your needs
- **Restricted Mode**: Enable with `-r` flag to prevent potentially harmful operations
- **Standard Mode**: Uses regular shell by default (bash on Unix/Mac, cmd on Windows)
- **Security Controls**: Restricted mode prevents:
  - Changing directories
  - Setting/modifying environment variables
  - Executing commands with absolute paths
  - Modifying shell options

**Example**:

```bash
# Standard mode (default)
forge

# Restricted secure mode
forge -r
```

### 4. Autocomplete

Boost your productivity with intelligent command completion:

- Type `@` and press Tab for contextual file/path completion
- Use Right Arrow to complete previously executed commands
- Access command history with Up Arrow
- Quick history search with Ctrl+R

### 6. WYSIWYG Shell Integration

Enhance your interactive shell experience with WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) integration. 'forge' now visualizes each command executed, complete with colorful formatting, allowing you to see command outputs just as if you were typing them directly into your terminal. This feature ensures clarity and enhances interaction, making every command visible in rich detail.

### 7. Command Interruption

Stay in control of your shell environment with intuitive command handling:

- **Cancel with `CTRL+C`:** Gracefully interrupt ongoing operations, providing the flexibility to halt processes that no longer need execution.
- **Exit with `CTRL+D`:** Easily exit the shell session without hassle, ensuring you can quickly terminate your operations when needed.

## Why Shell?

There's a reason why the shell stood the test of time for all dev tools and still remains a cornerstone of development environments across the globe: it's fast, versatile, and seamlessly integrated with the system. The shell is where we navigate code, run tests, manage processes, and orchestrate our development environments, providing an unmatched level of control and productivity.

**Why a shell-based AI assistant like Code-Forge makes sense:**

- **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: The shell gives you immediate access to powerful Unix tools (grep, awk, sed, find) that LLMs already understand deeply. This means the AI can leverage `ripgrep` for code search, `jq` for JSON processing, `git` for version control, and hundreds of other battle-tested tools without reinventing them.

- **Context is Everything**: Your shell session already has your complete development context - current directory, project structure, environment variables, installed tools, and system state. This rich context makes the AI interactions more accurate and relevant.

- **Speed Matters**: Unlike IDEs and Web UI, Code Forge's shell is extremely light weight. This exceptional speed unlocks powerful capabilities that directly enhance your productivity: seamlessly get in and out of workflows, managing multiple feature developments in parallel, effortlessly coordinate across git worktrees, and instantly access AI assistance in any directory.

- **Tool Composition**: Unix philosophy teaches us to make tools that compose well. The AI can pipe commands together, combining tools like `find | xargs forge -p | grep "foo"` in ways that solve complex problems elegantly.
