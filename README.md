## Installation

### Mac

Using Homebrew (macOS package manager):

```bash
# Add Code-Forge's package repository to Homebrew
brew tap antinomyhq/code-forge
# Install Code-Forge
brew install code-forge
```

### Linux

Choose either method to install:

```bash
# Using curl (common download tool)
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antinomyhq/forge/main/install.sh | bash

# Or using wget (alternative download tool)
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antinomyhq/forge/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Get Started

1. Create a `.env` file in your home directory with your API credentials and model preferences:

```bash
# Your OpenRouter API key for accessing AI models
OPEN_ROUTER_KEY=<Enter your Open Router Key>

# Preferred model for complex tasks requiring deeper analysis
FORGE_LARGE_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet

# Efficient model for quick, routine tasks
FORGE_SMALL_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku
```

2. Start an interactive shell by typing `forge`:

```bash
forge
âš¡ # Write your task here and press enter or type
```

For additional configuration options and features, use `forge --help`.

## Features

### 1. Interactive Shell

Transform your command-line experience with natural language interaction while maintaining the power and flexibility of traditional shell commands.

**Example**:
Start the interactive shell with:

```bash
forge
```

### 2. Enhanced Security

Code-Forge prioritizes security by using restricted bash (rbash) by default, limiting potentially dangerous operations:

- **Default Restricted Mode**: Uses rbash to prevent unauthorized access and potentially harmful operations
- **Unrestricted Access**: Available when needed via the `-u` flag
- **Safe by Default**: Protects your system while maintaining functionality

**Example**:

```bash
# Default secure mode
forge

# Unrestricted mode when needed
forge -u
```

### 3. Model Flexibility

Optimize your workflow by choosing the right AI model for each task:

- **Quick Tasks**: Use lightweight models for rapid responses
- **Complex Operations**: Leverage more powerful models for in-depth analysis

**Configuration**:

```bash
export FORGE_LARGE_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
export FORGE_SMALL_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku
```

### 4. Autocomplete

Boost your productivity with intelligent command completion:

- Type `@` and press Tab for contextual file/path completion
- Use Right Arrow to complete previously executed commands
- Access command history with Up Arrow
- Quick history search with Ctrl+R

### 5. Custom Instructions

Tailor Code-Forge to your specific needs with custom instruction sets:

```bash
forge --custom-instructions path/to/instructions.yml
```

### 6. Custom Agents

Transform forge into specialized expert agents by creating custom agent profiles that define their behavior, expertise, and capabilities. Each agent can be tailored for specific tasks or domains using mustache templates:

```bash
forge --agent prompts/technical_writer_agent.txt
```

Agent profiles support mustache templates that can access variables from the following context type:

```typescript
/**
 * Represents the complete context available to system prompts in forge.
 * All fields can be accessed using mustache template syntax.
 */
type SystemContext = {
  /**
   * Environment information about the current system and workspace.
   * Access fields using {{env.field_name}} in templates.
   */
  env: {
    /**
     * The operating system identifier.
     * Possible values: "macos", "linux", "windows"
     */
    operating_system: string;

    /**
     * Absolute path to the current working directory.
     * Example: "/Users/username/projects/my-app"
     */
    current_working_directory: string;

    /**
     * Path to the default shell being used.
     * Usually "/bin/rbash" for restricted shell mode
     * or system default like "/bin/bash", "/bin/zsh"
     */
    default_shell: string;

    /**
     * Absolute path to the user's home directory.
     * Example: "/Users/username"
     */
    home_directory: string;

    /**
     * List of files and directories in the current working directory.
     * Includes both files and subdirectories at the root level.
     */
    file_list: string[];
  };

  /**
   * Detailed information about available tools and their capabilities.
   * Includes function names, descriptions, parameters, and return types.
   * Access using {{tool_information}} in templates.
   */
  tool_information: string;

  /**
   * Indicates whether tools are available in the current context.
   * Use {{#if tool_supported}}...{{/if}} for conditional rendering.
   */
  tool_supported: boolean;

  /**
   * Custom instructions provided via --custom-instructions flag.
   * Will be null if no custom instructions were provided.
   * Access using {{custom_instructions}} in templates.
   */
  custom_instructions: string | null;

  /**
   * Array of relevant file paths in the current context.
   * Paths are relative to the current working directory.
   * Iterate using {{#each files}}{{this}}{{/each}} in templates.
   */
  files: string[];
};
```

**Example custom prompt template:**

```mustache
You are a technical expert working in the {{env.operating_system}} environment.
Current directory: {{env.current_working_directory}}

Available tools:
{{tool_information}}

Your task is to assist with development tasks in this context using the available tools.
{{#if custom_instructions}}
Additional instructions: {{custom_instructions}}
{{/if}}

Files in scope:
{{#each files}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}
```

You can create your own prompt templates or modify existing ones to adapt forge's behavior to specific tasks or workflows. The system context ensures the AI assistant has full awareness of your development environment.

### 7. WYSIWYG Shell Integration

Enhance your interactive shell experience with WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) integration. 'forge' now visualizes each command executed, complete with colorful formatting, allowing you to see command outputs just as if you were typing them directly into your terminal. This feature ensures clarity and enhances interaction, making every command visible in rich detail.

### 8. Command Interruption

Stay in control of your shell environment with intuitive command handling:

- **Cancel with `CTRL+C`:** Gracefully interrupt ongoing operations, providing the flexibility to halt processes that no longer need execution.
- **Exit with `CTRL+D`:** Easily exit the shell session without hassle, ensuring you can quickly terminate your operations when needed.

## Why Shell?

There's a reason why the shell stood the test of time for all dev tools and still remains a cornerstone of development environments across the globe: it's fast, versatile, and seamlessly integrated with the system. The shell is where we navigate code, run tests, manage processes, and orchestrate our development environments, providing an unmatched level of control and productivity.

**Why a shell-based AI assistant like Code-Forge makes sense:**

- **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: The shell gives you immediate access to powerful Unix tools (grep, awk, sed, find) that LLMs already understand deeply. This means the AI can leverage `ripgrep` for code search, `jq` for JSON processing, `git` for version control, and hundreds of other battle-tested tools without reinventing them.

- **Context is Everything**: Your shell session already has your complete development context - current directory, project structure, environment variables, installed tools, and system state. This rich context makes the AI interactions more accurate and relevant.

- **Speed Matters**: Unlike IDEs and Web UI, Code Forge's shell is extremely light weight. This exceptional speed unlocks powerful capabilities that directly enhance your productivity: seamlessly get in and out of workflows, managing multiple feature developments in parallel, effortlessly coordinate across git worktrees, and instantly access AI assistance in any directory.

- **Tool Composition**: Unix philosophy teaches us to make tools that compose well. The AI can pipe commands together, combining tools like `find | xargs forge -p | grep "foo"` in ways that solve complex problems elegantly.
