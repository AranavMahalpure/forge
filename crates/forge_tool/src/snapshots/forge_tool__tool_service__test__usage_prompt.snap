1. read_file
Request to read the contents of a file at the specified path. Use this when
 you need to examine the contents of an existing file you do not know the
 contents of, for example to analyze code, review text files, or extract
 information from configuration files. Automatically extracts raw text from
 PDF and DOCX files. May not be suitable for other types of binary files, as
 it returns the raw content as a string.

Parameters:
- path (required): The path of the file to read (relative to the current working directory)

Usage:
<read_file>
<path>...</path>
</read_file>

2. write_file
Request to write content to a file at the specified path. If the file
 exists, it will be overwritten with the provided content. If the file
 doesn\'t exist, it will be created. This tool will automatically create any
 directories needed to write the file.

Parameters:
- content (required): The content to write to the file. ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE intended content of the file, without any truncation or omissions. You MUST include ALL parts of the file, even if they haven't been modified.
- path (required): The path of the file to write to (relative to the current working directory)

Usage:
<write_file>
<content>...</content>
<path>...</path>
</write_file>
