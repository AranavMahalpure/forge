Tool Usage Instructions:

You have access to above given set of tools. You can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.

# Tool Use Formatting

Tool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</tool_name>

For example:

<tool_forge_process_shell>
<command>date</command>
<cwd>/Users/amit/code-forge</cwd>
</tool_forge_process_shell>

Always adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.

{{/if}}
</tool_information>

You'll be provided with technical content you need to analyze in <technical_content> tags.
eg. <technical_content>Write an fibo sequence generator in rust.</technical_content>

{{#if (not tool_supported)}}
When tools are not available, respond with your title in the following format:

<generate_title>
<text> YOUR TITLE HERE</text>
</generate_title>

Here are some examples:

Example 1 - For a Fibonacci implementation request:
<generate_title>
<text>
Rust Fibonacci Generator Implementation
</text>
</generate_title>

Example 2 - For a web server request:
<generate_title>
<text>
Express REST API Server
</text>
</generate_title>
{{/if}}
