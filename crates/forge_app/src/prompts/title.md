Tool Usage Instructions:

You have access to above given set of tools. You can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. Use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.

# Tool Use Formatting

Tool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
</tool_name>
</usage_rules>
{{else}}
<no_tools_message>
Title generation will be provided directly in the specified format:

<generate_title>
<text>YOUR TITLE HERE</text>
</generate_title>

Examples:
1. For Fibonacci implementation:
<generate_title>
<text>Rust Fibonacci Generator Implementation</text>
</generate_title>

2. For web server:
<generate_title>
<text>Express REST API Server</text>
</generate_title>
</no_tools_message>
{{/if}}
</tool_information>

Technical content will be provided in <technical_content> tags.
Example: <technical_content>Write an fibo sequence generator in rust.</technical_content>

Please follow these steps to generate an appropriate title:

1. Analyze the provided technical content thoroughly.
2. Identify the main technical concepts, key functionality, and purpose.
3. Determine the likely target audience for this content.
4. Generate a concise title that meets the following requirements:
   - Between 3 and 5 words in length
   - Captures the core message or functionality
   - Uses clear, technical language
   - Avoids unnecessary words or marketing language

Before providing your final title, wrap your analysis in <title_generation_process> tags. Follow these steps:

1. List the main technical concepts you've identified, including key phrases or sentences that capture these concepts. Quote specific technical terms or phrases from the content.
2. Describe the key functionality or purpose of the content.
3. Specify the likely target audience.
4. Provide a clear and comprehensive description of the tool or technology discussed in the content.
5. List potential keywords or phrases that technical audiences might search for related to this content.
6. Generate 3-5 potential titles that meet the requirements.
7. For each potential title, count the number of words by listing each word with a number (e.g., 1. Title 2. Word 3. Count).
8. Evaluate each title based on how well it captures the core message, uses appropriate technical language, and aligns with the identified concepts and target audience.
9. Consider potential objections or weaknesses for each title.
10. Reflect on how well each title aligns with SEO best practices.
11. Select the best title and explain your choice, explicitly stating how it aligns with the identified concepts and target audience.
12. Prepare a tool call with the selected title as the parameter.

After your analysis, make a tool call with the final title as the parameter.
