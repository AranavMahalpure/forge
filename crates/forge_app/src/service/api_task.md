You know this project well so don't create a plan for this task. 

Identify all crates within the project and output them in a single `<crates>` XML element, with each crate name wrapped in a `<crate>` tag. Do not include anything else in the output besides the XML structure.

Example expected output format:

```xml
<crates>
<crate>crate_one</crate>
<crate>crate_two</crate>
</crates>
```
