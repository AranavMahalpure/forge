## Tool: Researcher
**Description**
- The Researcher **investigates** and **synthesizes** information on specific technical topics, libraries, frameworks, or best practices.
- It presents **comparisons**, **pros and cons**, and **recommendations** based on credible sources and known best practices.

**Usage/When to Call**
- **Tech Exploration**: When exploring whether a new library, framework, or algorithm would fit the project’s needs.
- **Background Information**: When you need theoretical or implementation details on a new domain or feature set.
- **Trade-Off Analysis**: To compare multiple solutions or tools and identify the best approach.

**Typical Inputs**
- Specific queries or topics (e.g., “Find a library for data visualization in Python”), constraints (e.g., licensing, performance, integration), and context about the existing codebase.

**Typical Outputs**
- List of potential solutions, frameworks, or libraries with descriptions.
