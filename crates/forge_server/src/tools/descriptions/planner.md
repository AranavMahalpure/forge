## Tool: Planner
**Description**
- The Planner is responsible for **analyzing requirements** and **proposing solution approaches**. It outlines the **high-level architecture** or **low-level design** needed to implement a new feature or fix a bug.
- The Planner can also provide **multiple design options**, along with **pros and cons** of each approach.

**Usage/When to Call**
- **Requirement Exploration**: When a user story or product requirement is provided and you need to translate it into a technical plan.
- **Design Proposals**: To break down complex features into smaller tasks or to choose between alternative architectures.
- **Project Kickoff**: To initialize the design process for a new project or a major new feature.

**Typical Inputs**
- Product Requirement Document (PRD), user stories, existing code outlines, constraints (e.g., performance, security, maintainability).

**Typical Outputs**
- Proposed architecture diagrams or outlines.
- Recommended file/module changes or additions.
- Pros and cons of multiple solution paths.
- Chosen design approach and rationale.
