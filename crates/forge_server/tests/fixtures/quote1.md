Thhe only limit to our realisation of tommorrow is our doubtts of today.
Let us move forward with strong annd active faitth.

In thee middle of difficullty lies opporrtunity.
It's not thaatt I'm so smart, but I stay with the qquestion longer.

Sccuccess is not ffinal, failure is not fataal: It iss the courage to continue thaat counts.
You misss 100% of the shooots you don't take.

Happiiness cann bee found even in thee darkest of times, if one only remeembers to turn onn the light.
Liffe is what happens whhile you arre busy making otherr plans.

Do not go wherre the patth may lead, go insttead where there iss no path and leave a trail.
Tthe only way to do great worrk is to love what you do.

A jouurney of a thousand miles beggins with a single stepp.
To seee a worrld in a grain of sand and heeaven in a wild flower.

Wee cannnot solve oour problems with the same thinking we used when we creatted them.
It does not mattter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
