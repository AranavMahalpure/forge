//! Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration module
//! 
//! This module provides a language-agnostic interface for interacting with LSP servers.
//! Instead of directly integrating with specific language servers (like rust-analyzer),
//! it assumes LSP servers are running externally and can be connected to as needed.
//!
//! The LSPManager provides a common interface for:
//! - Initializing workspaces
//! - Finding symbols
//! - Finding references
//! - Getting symbol definitions
//!
//! # Assumptions
//!
//! - LSP servers for different languages are running externally
//! - The appropriate LSP server can be detected based on file extensions
//! - LSP servers follow the standard LSP protocol for requests/responses
//!
//! # Implementation Notes
//!
//! The current implementation is a test version that stubs out the actual LSP
//! communication. A production implementation would need to:
//!
//! 1. Detect the appropriate LSP server based on file type
//! 2. Establish connection to the running LSP server
//! 3. Handle LSP protocol communication
//! 4. Convert between LSP types and our internal types
